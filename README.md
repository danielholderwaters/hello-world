# hello-world
where I'm putting some code I've written before creating this account

I'm joining github after many years of writing r code in what may have been utter solitude.  
Last night I went to a "tech meetup" in Louisville where a CTO was talking about what he looks for in a new hire.  
There was the "I'm looking to see if you can do the job" bit, but one of the main metrics he used for gauging the seriousness/experience/talent/teachability of the candidate is the code present on github and the number of commits.  

This working in the dark was more isolating than I thought - the only trace of my work is on my favorite external hard drive and some code now (almost certainly) being ignored at Schneider Electric.  
So here I am, contributing to open-sourceness and being somewhat self-serving at the same time.

Also, I love intricate and long board games (the more intricate and longer the better).  
My favorites include Diplomacy, Twilight Imperium, Axis and Allies, Agricola & Game of Thrones. 
If I can't be playing one of these or a game that claims to be better, I'd settle for ye olde card games like bridge or euchre or spades or hearts.

I'm recently a father.  
I quit my old gig at Schneider so I could hang out at home with my wife and new daughter for an indefinite period of time. 
This is the hardest job I've ever had.
In the throes of a two month old's cries are like being reminded of how terrible a human you are, and adding on top of that list "torture of a new and innocent human".
Other than that, being a dad is a wild ride.  
While my wife is the kiddo's favorite person (breastmilk gives her an unfair advantage), I am the best person in the entire world at calming the kid down and making her laugh.  
At four months old, she can laugh and smile and ten seconds of a baby laughing erases an hour of the "stop torturing me" scream from my emotional memory.
